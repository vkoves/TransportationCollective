# Transportation Collective
<img src="/images/android-desktop.png?raw=true" "Optional Title" align="right">
A big data collection and analysis website created specifically for collecting and viewing complaints and issues on the CTA.

Uses many different Google APIs to work with no backend database. Users submit issues into a Google Form, which places the data into a Google Sheet. This Google Sheet is then read through the Google Docs APIs and the data is visualized using the Google Graphing API and the Google Maps API.

The Transportation Collective website also used to use cookies to store a users favorite stops on their local machine, but this functionality is currently deprecated, as you can only see the status of whole lines, and not individual stops.

Hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) through Viktor's website, find the website  [here](http://viktorkoves.com/TransportationCollective/).
